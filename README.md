# terraform-simple-acm
Wrapper around ACM stuff, mostly because I want to play with Terraform modules


Works on the assumption that you're using Route53 for DNS verification


Usage:

```
module "simple_acm" {
  # Source the module from GitHub
  source = "git::https://github.com/lucymhdavies/terraform-simple-acm.git?ref=master"

  # Domain name and hosted zone name
  domain_name = "foo.example.com"
  zone_id    = "${data.aws_route53_zone.example-com.zone_id}"

  # Optional
  providers = {
    # Use us-east-1 if you need this for CloudFront
    aws = "aws.us-east-1"
  }
}
```
